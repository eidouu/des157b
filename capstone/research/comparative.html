        <p>frankenSim acts as a portfolio website, but one key distinction is its unique layout modeled after a desktop GUI. By modeling it after a desktop, it creates a playful and immersive experience that stands out from other websites. Content appear as draggable windows by clicking on the desktop icons, which allows users to read through multiple pages at once without having to leave the main page. If users find this too underwhelming, they can simply close as many windows as they want or even move it elsewhere on the screen. This type of freedom given to users is what I want to replicate to create an educational website about the Davis Seal.</p>

        <p>PoolSuite is another desktop GUI inspired website that, compared to frankenSim, focuses more on its aesthetic style and customizability. The pixelated font and default beige color scheme seem inspired by retro PC operating systems. However, what stood out to me was the ability to change the theme and background of the website by choosing from a list, as well as including a built-in music player widget. Although these aren't essential components that I would want in my website, I do appreciate the creativity the designer showcased as it creates a more immersive and empowers the users in choosing their own way of consuming content. </p>
