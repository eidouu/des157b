    <h1>Usability Test Results</h1>

    <h2>Adding More Seal Imagery</h2>
    <p>The project's main focus is the seal itself, but there isn't any reference to it at all. Adding maybe an image or even a minimalistic vector illustration in the icon would be nice.</p>

    <h2>Adding a Drawing App</h2>
    <p>A user pointed out that a drawing app where users can freely draw whatever they want would be a good addition to the app. My target audience are 4th graders to 6th graders where if I'm just throwing information at them, they probably won't absorb any knowledge at all. Although I'm still considering about whether or not to implement it, a drawing app would add another playful element to the website to help retain attention span.</p>

    <h2>Letting Users Resize Windows</h2>
    <p>Everyone will have different sized screens, so adding the ability to help users even further customize their reading experience would help usability.</p>
