        <h2>davis seal paper prototypes</h2>

        <p>This was a hard project to execute as a paper prototype. Since my website's main theme is that users get to explore the website however they want, there isn't any set user flow that I expected them to follow. For now, my main challenge will be to make people understand how they can navigate through this website and know that they can scroll in the windows.  </p>
