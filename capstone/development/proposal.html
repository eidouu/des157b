    <h1>capstone proposal</h1>

    <h2>topic and  target audience</h2>
        <p>I would like to do an interactive mini-game where K-12 (or K-6 if I need to be more specific) students are able to explore the website to learn more about the history of the Davis Seal and its contents. I believe that having an emphasis on visuals and creating a game that rewards users for completing the game encourages people to learn the most, but I'm not sure about the specific details of how I want to accomplish this just yet.</p>

    <h2>partner?</h2>
        <p>I plan on working alone, but I would to see other peers' work to get some inspiration!</p>

    <h2>features</h2>
        <p>This is just an idea for now but I was thinking my website could be based off a desktop screen, where information about the seal are scattered throughout the screen in the form of desktop icons. By clicking on each file, the website would keep track of how many pages users have interacted with and would give a small "hooray you did it!" page. Not too sure if this would entice users enough.</p>

    <h2>potential issues and challenges</h2>
        <p>Again, I'm not sure if this idea would be effective enough in drawing in attention and immersing users into this website. I want to look at other educational-like websites and analyze their effectiveness before committing to this idea.</p>
